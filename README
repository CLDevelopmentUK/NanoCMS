## NanoCMS v0.4
  NanoCMS was intended to be the smallest, easiest and simplest flat-file no-frills CMS in PHP.
  I have discontinued working on this project. v0.4 is the last version I released in 2009.
  You can obtain the lastest community version here - nanocms.co.uk!

  Personally I feel v0.4 is the last release which adheres to the initial design goal of being the Smallest CMS.
  Happy browsing.
